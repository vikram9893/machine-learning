    "unseen data. Here's a breakdown of each concept, their consequences, and potential mitigation strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting:\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs extremely well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data.\n",
    "It happens when the model learns the training data's noise or random fluctuations instead of capturing the underlying patterns.\n",
    "Key characteristics of overfitting include excessively complex models with too many parameters relative to the available data.\n",
    "Consequences of Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor Generalization: The overfitted model may struggle to make accurate predictions on unseen data, leading to poor performance \n",
    "in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "High Variance: The model's performance may vary significantly with different training data samples, indicating high sensitivity to noise or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigation Strategies for Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase Training Data: Adding more diverse and representative data to the training set can help the model capture the underlying\n",
    "patterns better and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "Feature Selection/Dimensionality Reduction: Removing irrelevant or redundant features or applying dimensionality reduction\n",
    "techniques can reduce model complexity and focus on the most informative features.\n",
    "Regularization: Introducing regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, can add a penalty to the model's complexity, \n",

    "\n",
    "Underfitting:\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in \n",

    "Consequences of Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Learning: The model may not capture the essential relationships or patterns in the data, leading to poor predictive performance.\n",
    "High Bias: Underfitted models tend to have high bias, meaning they make overly simplified assumptions about the data.\n",
    "Mitigation Strategies for Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase Model Complexity: Consider using more powerful or complex models that can better capture the relationships in the data, \n",
    "such as increasing the number of layers in a neural network or using a more sophisticated algorithm.\n",
    "Feature Engineering: Analyze the data and engineer new features that provide more meaningful and informative representations\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the relationship between \n",

    "\n",
    "Variance, on the other hand, refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. It measures how much the model's\n",

    "\n",
    "The relationship between bias and variance can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "to generalize well to new data and exhibits high sensitivity to small changes in the training set.\n",
